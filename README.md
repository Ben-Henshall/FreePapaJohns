# FreePapaJohns
A script for repeatedly entering a Papa johns contest.

##To use:

Requires Python2.7. Sorry.

pip install Selenium

download http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.23/chromedriver_win32.zip and place it in Python/scripts.

Change "NUM_OF_POINTS_TO_STOP_ON", "PLUS_PREFIX", "EMAILUSER" and "EMAILPROVIDER".

NUM_OF_POINTS_TO_STOP_ON is the points you'd like to stop running the script on, e.g. stop running when you've won at least 12 points would be ["12","25"]. Default is to stop on any win.

PLUS_PREFIX is the prefix after the + in your email. Set it to a new original value every time you restart the bot.

EMAILUSER is first half of email, the part before the @.

EMAILPROVIDER is the second part of email, after the @.


#I DO NOT CONDONE GETTING FREE PIZZAS FROM PAPJOHNS. IT IS, TECHNICALLY, STEALING.
